# Version 0.3
Flapi 0.3 includes several bugfixes, as well as some new features.

## Javadocs
Documentation is now available using the `withDocumentation`. Because of this, javadocs have been added to the
generated Flapi descriptor classes.

## Deprecation
Methods can now be marked as @Deprecated, which allows an API to be changed more incrementally.
Use the `markAsDeprecated(..)` method on descriptor methods to enable this.

## Method Grouping
Methods which are marked `atMost(..)` can now be grouped together within the same block.
This means that when one goes, so does the other. Use this in place of unnecessary anonymous blocks.
The new documentation methods, for example, make use of this.

## Demonstration Video
A screencast which attempts to explain the basic use of Flapi has been posted [here](http://vimeo.com/58855907).

## Resolved Issues

### Bug
    + [FLAPI-95] - Blocks with no methods should be rejected.
    + [FLAPI-103] - Top level return types not working as expected.
    + [FLAPI-105] - Failure to recognize two classes as different, resulting in compiler error.

### Feature
    + [FLAPI-49] - Add the ability to annotate builder methods as @Deprecated
    + [FLAPI-57] - Allow users to add javadoc comments to interface methods.
    + [FLAPI-102] - Support anonymous blocks.
    + [FLAPI-111] - Support method grouping.

### Improvement
    + [FLAPI-20] - Divide the single 'monolithic' package into subpackages, one per block.
    + [FLAPI-93] - Reject invalid method names in all descriptor methods.
    + [FLAPI-108] - Avoid name collisions in anonymous blocks.
    + [FLAPI-115] - Add Javadocs to Flapi builder methods, now that they are available.

### Task
    + [FLAPI-71] - Reorganize BlockGenerator file
    + [FLAPI-104] - Integrate Travis-CI
    + [FLAPI-106] - Create demo and screen share.
    	+ Watch the video [here](vimeo.com/58855907)
